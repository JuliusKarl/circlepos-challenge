# Circlepos Frontend Developer Challenge
This project achieves the requirements of the Circlepos Frontend Developer challenge:

>You are tasked with developing a landing page for a bookstore site. You can retrieve the data for available books from the provided dummy server API (with documentation included) at: 
 https://github.com/jpyepez/circle-frontend-challenge
>
>The site must include:
>- A landing page which displays the list of available books and some basic information (from
>whatâ€™s provided by the API, at your discretion).
>- The landing page must provide a way to navigate to a dedicated page for each one of the items
>with additional details (similarly, as provided by the API).
>- The item page must allow the user to purchase a copy of the book via a provided endpoint.
